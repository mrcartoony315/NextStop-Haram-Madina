                "Before assuming Ihram, it’s a highly recommended Sunnah to perform Ghusl. It’s also recommended to clip your nails and remove excess body hair. As you’ll be travelling on an international flight, this should be performed before leaving your home. Men may also wish to apply Attar/perfume to their heads/beards, ensuring not to get any on the Ihram garments.",
                "Change into your Ihram. Men should wear two white sheets: One is wrapped around the waist, while the other is used to cover the top half of the body. Sandals may be worn that do not cover the ankle, and it is not permissible to wear a hat or turban. Women are to wear their normal dress, but should not wear gloves or cover their face. Ensure you change into your Ihram attire before crossing the Miqat. You will likely be travelling to Saudi Arabia via plane, so you should change into your Ihram at the airport prior to departure or during a stopover if you have one.",
                "Pray Salah al-Ihram. It’s Sunnah to perform two Rakahs of Salah before entering into the state of Ihram. This can be performed after getting changed at the airport or in-flight before crossing the Miqat, providing there are prayer facilities on-board. Observe the prayer with the intention of performing two Rakahs Nafl for Ihram. It is recommended to recite Sural al-Kafirun (109) in the first Rakah and Surah al-Ikhlas (Surah 112) in the second, although other Surahs may be read.",
                "Make the intention for Umrah. For those flying from the UK/ abroad, the Miqaat is passed 20-30 minutes before landing. This is the point at which one must make the intention for Umrah, by reciting the following: َ ْكﯾﱠﺑَﻟﱠُمﮭﱠﻠﻟا ًْرَةﻣُﻋ Transliteration: Labbayk Allahumma bi-Umrah. Translation:Here I am O Allah making Umrah.",
                "Recite the Talbiyyah from this point onwards. Men should recite this in a loud voice without disturbing others, while women should recite this softly. َ ْكﯾﱠﺑَﻟﱠُمﮭﻠﻟا َْكﯾﱠﺑَﻟ– َْكﯾﱠﺑَﻟ َﻻ َْكﯾَِرﺷ ََكﻟ َْكﯾﱠﺑَﻟ–ﱠنِإ َْدﻣَﺣْﻟا َﺔَﻣْﻌﱢﻧﻟوَا ََكﻟ َْكﻠُﻣْﻟوَا– َﻻ َْكﯾَِرﺷ ََكﻟ Transliteration: Labbayka llāhumma labbayk(a), labbayka lā sharīka laka labbayk(a), inna l-ḥamda wa n-ni’mata, laka wa l-mulk(a), lā sharīka lak.
